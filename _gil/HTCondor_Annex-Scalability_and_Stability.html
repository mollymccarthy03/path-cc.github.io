            One challenge for High-throughput computing (HTC) is integrating with the
            computational cloud or other clusters to provide more computational power. HTCondor
            Annex can create working nodes on clusters using schedulers such as HTCondor, Slurm,
            and others.
        </p>
        <h2>Executive summary</h2>
        <p>
            The HTCondor Annex creates a way to provide more computational power using the
            same structure as a standard HTCondor environment. About the HTCondor Annex and the
            test environment:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All the tests were in the ap40.uw.osg-htc.org and ap1.facility.path-cc.io as an
                HTCondor Annex target.</li>
            <li>The methodology was based on the absolute number of worker daemons, the absolute
                number of worker daemons, peaks execute daemon termination, the external killing
                of executed daemons when the system is loaded, and the long-term stability of an
                extensive system.</li>
            <li>We ran jobs for three months, more than 250k jobs, and more than 100k Annex.</li>
            <li>The HTCondor Annex creation process frequency could be increased; the results
                show the Annex creation frequency decreases while the number of annexes increases.</li>
            <li>The annex can only be created if you create fewer jobs (50k jobs). The appendix
                shows the output of the attempt to create the Annex after the job creation.</li>
            <li>Integrating clusters besides the one already coded on the HTCondor Annex is
                impossible.</li>
            <li>The job removal doesn’t always work to remove the HTCondor Annexes from the
                target host. SSH sessions toward the target are also sometimes left behind</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
            The recommendations are ordered related to the user impact.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Improve the checks when an Annex or job is interrupted; there are cases where the
                jobs stay on target.</li>
            <li>Fix orphaned SSH connections toward target after the Annexes have terminated.</li>
            <li>Create multiple jobs in the same scripts (“queue X”) using HTCondor Annex.</li>
            <li>Show the options for shared connection before the Annex starts the process. This
                could be very useful to prevent problems with the 2-step or CILogon authentication
                style. Figure 4 shows the output of a command to create an Annex and the CILogon
                authentication request.</li>
            <li>It is required to create all the jobs first and the Annexes afterward. It is interesting
                to be able to create the annex and the jobs or vice versa.</li>
            <li>Integrate or warn about the fact that condor_store_cred needs to start the Annexes.</li>
            <li>Adding other targets using configuration files in the HTCondor Annex is essential;
                now, it is only possible to use a “coded set” of targets.</li>
            <li>Give feedback about the SSH timeout command; it helps debug firewall issues.</li>
            <li>Consider an alternative for opening port 9618 for security reasons and
                administration issues.</li>
            <li>Create a command to check the status of the target jobs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            The methodology applied to test the HTCondor Annex has a few goals to cover
            scalability, stability, and performance:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Absolute number of worker daemons
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Peaks execute daemon provisioning to show that we can start many execute
                        daemons within a short amount of time and have jobs start on them.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Peaks execute daemon termination.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>After having many execute daemons running, set up either job termination or
                        Annex auto-termination to happen as closely as possible together.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The external killing of executed daemons when the system is loaded (e.g., over 20k
                already)
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Measure the success/error rates of the daemons de-registering from the
                        negotiator, clean up after themselves, and adequately reflect termination in
                        Annex commands.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Long-term stability of an extensive system
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>After bringing the system to a large baseline (e.g., 20k), check if it is possible
                        to sustain that.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tests HTCondor Annex</h2>
        <p>
            Table 1 shows the tests run using the HTCondor Annex, using the ap40.uw.osg-
            htc.org (HTCondor Annex) and ap1.facility.path-cc.io (worker target). The results are
            positive, negative, and neutral. Positive results mean the tests ran without error messages
            or other problems; a neutral result means the test was executed successfully. Still, some
            aspects must be analyzed, and a negative result means the test could not run.

This will (as the default project) request 1 CPUs for 1.00 hours for an
annex named 'path12' from the queue named 'cpu' on the system named 'PATh
Facility'. To change the project, use --project. To change the resources
requested, use either --nodes or one or more of --cpus and --mem_mb. To
change how long the resources are reqested for, use --lifetime (in seconds).

This command will access the system named 'PATh Facility' via SSH. To
proceed, follow the prompts from that system below; to cancel, hit CTRL-C.
